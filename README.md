# Sales Strategies for Supermarkets using Machine Learning

Developed and Implemented Apriori algorithm in Python from scratch in the 5 transactional datasets (Nike, Adidas, Shoprite, K-mart, Best-Buy) of the past 
5 years. 

Implementation of this model determines which products are most likely to be purchased together using user defined support and confidence.

The retailers can then adjust sales strategies.

The data Data sets consist of data items names and 20 tuples for each dataset. The items and translations are selected randomly based on data from each site. 

Shoprite data base is using the labels A,B,C, D, E as items names and transactions.The Custom data is filled by the user to any other data to use. 

The custom data must follow the example provided to the user in other data in order to work.

NOTE: Any data set can be changed as long as the file follows the same format

Data sets are included with the project package in the folder data. There are 5 data sets in total: Nike, K- Mart, BestBuy, Amazon, Shoprite.
They are in CSV format
